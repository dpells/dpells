# :point_left: Hi! I'm David Pellegrini (dpells02)

I'm a software developer 👨‍💻, part-time professor at Cambrian College 👨‍🏫, and game designer 🎮 in Nortnern Ontario. Most of the repos here for now are for my students at Cambrian College to be able to quickly share the code we look at in class, but there are a few fun repos sprinkled in for game design and app development. I'm also a chapter lead for [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/) running workshops to help introduce people to technology, and [GDG Sudbury](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-sudbury/) running workshops and talks on all sorts of technology. As of writing this (July 2020) we're actually working on planning our [2020 DevFest](https://github.com/CCSudbury/gdg-sudbury-devfest)!

This README will probably be a work in progress for a while, but it's going to be fun to play with in the long term
