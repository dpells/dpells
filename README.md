# Hi! I'm David Pellegrini (dpells02)

I'm a software developer, part-time professor at Cambrian College, and game designer.  Most of the repos here for now are for my students at Cambrian College to be able to quickly share the code we look at in class, but there are a few fun repos sprinkled in for game design and app development.
